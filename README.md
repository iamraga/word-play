# Word Play
A fun game developed using ReactJS and ANT design as a part of my learning process. 

ANT design came in really handy for my design needs and I've used the bare minimum of what it is actually capable of.
This is just a simple react app with no backend code. 

### Rearrange the letter blocks to guess the actual word
##### The rules are simple:
- There will be 10 rounds.
- The letters of a word will be given to you jumbled randomly.
- Rearrange the letter blocks and submit to guess the right word.
- If you're out of ideas, you can use up to 2 hints for a word.
- The maximum number of attempts in a round is 3, failing which the round will be marked 'wrongly answered'.
- Clicking on 'Skip to next word' will mark that word as wrongly answered and will jump to the next word.
- Kindly do not hit the refresh or back button. This will reset the game and erase your progress.

Give it a shot and see how many words you guess right.

Any feedback or correction will be really helpful.
